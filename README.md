# 3D-Pathfinding-and-Collision-Avoidance-for-Multiple-Projectiles
Project implements 3D pathfinding for multiple projectiles, accounting for obstacles and avoiding collisions. Algorithm computes paths between start and end points, dynamically adjusts for obstacles, ensuring safe and efficient projectile movement
